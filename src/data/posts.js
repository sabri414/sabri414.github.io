    excerpt:
      "Curiosity, restraint, and intentional creation — the principles that shape how I live and build.",
    content: [
      "I believe life is something you build, not something you rush through.",
      "Curiosity is my compass. I question systems, habits, and defaults — not to rebel, but to understand. Understanding creates freedom.",
      "I value restraint. Not everything needs to be optimized, posted, or monetized. Some things are meant to compound quietly.",
      "I build with people in mind. Technology should reduce friction, not increase noise. The best systems feel invisible.",
      "I believe consistency beats intensity. Small deliberate actions, repeated daily, shape identity.",
      "And finally — creativity is a responsibility. If you’re capable of building something that helps others think, feel, or live better, you probably should."
